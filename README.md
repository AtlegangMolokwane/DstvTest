Created an app to solve a movie scenario using ReactJs and Redux. 

## Run api
the api folder contains the api containing the movie list, on your terminal cd inside the folder and run " npm start " to run the api.

## the react app
" npm start " to run the app
you can check my libraries in package.json (I did not use all of the libraries in there)
