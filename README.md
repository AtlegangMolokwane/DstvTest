# DstvTest
Created an app to solve a movie scenario using ReactJs and Redux. 

## Run api
The api folder contains the api containing the movie list, on your terminal cd inside the folder and run " npm start " to run the api. It will not show any data if you do not run this. 

## The react app
PLEASE CLONE THE "dstv-top5" REPO (I have 3 repos in my account), ignore the "dstv-top5" folder in this repo. Once you have cloned it, on your terminal you can cd into the file and " npm start " to run the app.
